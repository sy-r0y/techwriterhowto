# Notes


In the how-to docs 

The bulk of time was spent figuring out how the flyctl commands work to play around with my app's machines & volumes, as well as tweaking at the command line to figure out which command works best for the desired outcome.
Using the community forum threads, I noticed that people were using two ways to "relocate" their app's machine/volume.
1. Using the fly scale method
2. Using the fly clone method

I realized that the clone method was not as straight-forward for my desired goal which was a simple relocation of my app from one region to another. So, I chose to not include the `clone` method in my How-To
