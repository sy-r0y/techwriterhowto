# Notes


In the how-to docs 

The bulk of time was spent figuring out how the flyctl commands work to play around with my app's machines & volumes, as well as tweaking at the command line to figure out which command works best for the desired outcome.
Using the community forum threads, I noticed that people were using two ways to "relocate" your app's machine/volume into a new region.
1. Using the fly scale method
2. Using the fly clone method
